## What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process of extracting data from a source, transforming it into a format that is more useful for analysis, and then loading it into a database or data warehouse.

## Why is ETL important?

ETL is important because it allows us to get data into a format that is more useful for analysis. For example, if we want to analyse the number of people who live in a certain area, we need to get the population data into a format that we can use to calculate the number of people in a certain area.

## What is the problem with ETL?

The problem with ETL is that it is slow. It can take a long time to extract data from a source, transform it into a format that is more useful for analysis, and then load it into a database or data warehouse.

## How can we make ETL faster?

We can make ETL faster by using GPUs and Apache Spark.

## What is a GPU?

A GPU is a graphics processing unit. It is a piece of hardware that is used to render graphics. GPUs are very fast at rendering graphics because they are designed to do a lot of calculations in parallel.

## What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a framework for processing data in parallel. It is designed to be fast and to be able to handle large amounts of data.

## How can we use GPUs and Apache Spark to make ETL faster?

We can use GPUs and Apache Spark to make ETL faster by using them to process data in parallel. This means that we can process data faster because we can do more calculations at the same time. We can also process more data at the same time because we can do more calculations at the same time.

## Example



```scala
// detect GPUs



import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

val df = spark.read
  .option("header", "true")
  .option("inferSchema", "true")
  .csv("s3://geodb-public-data/geojson/australia/australia-states.geojson")

df
  .withColumn("area", st_area($"geometry"))
  .withColumn("area", round($"area", 2))
  .withColumn("area", $"area" / 1000000)
  .withColumn("area", round($"area", 2))
  .withColumn("area", $"area" cast StringType)
  .withColumn("area", concat($"area", lit(" kmÂ²")))
  .select("area")
  .show()
```
