We push ourselves to think strategically about what truly matters. Itâ€™s dangerously easy to fall into the trap of trying to solve everything for everyone.

Value: **Continuous learning**

Explanation: We take the time to invest in uplevelling ourselves and our teammates. This could be taking half a day to read a research paper on replay, or scheduling regular pair programming sessions. We are open about our mistakes and reflect candidly on what could have gone better, so that we can improve for next time.

Value: **Collaboration**

Explanation: We always try to help each other, before we're asked to do so. We teach with compassion, which means sharing our knowledge and realizing the leverage of empowering our teammates. We support our teammates, win as a team and regularly celebrate this.

Value: **Keep it simple**
